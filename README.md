# Tableau_Walmart_Sales_Insight_Project
The Data set used in this project, is a cleaned version of the SQL Project data Set in my Repository 3 project (Walmart Sql Project).
 The Data was cleaned using MS SQL. To Optimize performance, I used Extract Connection and all Aggregations were preaggregated 
 in SQL before bringing it into Tableau.


This dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of Walmartâ€™s sales performance across different branches and product lines. Hereâ€™s what it covers:

ðŸ’¼ Branch Sales Performance: A breakdown of total sales by branch, highlighting top-performing locations.

ðŸ“Š Product Line Analysis: Insights into average unit price and quantity sold across various product lines, from electronics to home essentials.

ðŸ›’ Customer Demographics: Understanding sales patterns based on customer type (Member vs. Normal), payment type, and gender segmentation.

ðŸ“ˆ Sales Trends: Visualized trends showing total sales over time, enabling easy comparison and insights into sales performance.

Building this dashboard helped me further hone my skills in data storytelling and business intelligence. Leveraging Tableauâ€™s powerful features, I was able to provide actionable insights that can help optimize sales strategies and decision-making processes.
